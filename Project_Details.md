## Synopsis
We have selected the domain of communication for our project. <br/>
We are working towards developing an app using qt5, opencv and c++. This app will have a functionality to process a live image/ video and create effects like pencil sketching, cartoonizing and other computational imagery on the image/frame. <br/>
The milestones for this project are:<br/>
* Installation of opencv, c++ and qt5 on respective computers (windows/ubuntu),<br/>
* Read an image/webcam video using opencv,<br/>
* Familiarizing with opencv, qt5 and c++ through weekly projects/tasks,<br/>
* Development of qt app and using buttons to run different codes, and<br/>
Integrating image processing in qt5.<br/>
Following is the github link we would be using for the project, <br/>
